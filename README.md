# Unpusher

A pixel-perfect, open source clone of [pusher.exe](http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/09/04/sokoban-maps/), itself a 10kB DOS sokoban game. It's written in NASM x86 real mode assembly in order to be as small as possible.

Most of the game is complete (display, menu, input, level decoding), only the pushing mechanics are missing.
